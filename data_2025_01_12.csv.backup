Kat,Bell,PhoenixRising210@gmail.com,1377 Rosedale Street,Toccoa,GA - Georgia,30577,United States,14048772778,"I am a 51 year old survivor of severe child abuse and multiple adult domestic violence situations. I was a functionally homeless single mom on welfare in my 20s, but was able to get an education and have a self-sustaining career as a paralegal. Ive lost almost 100lbs and regained my health - physical and mental - through hiking and DDPYoga. In short‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve gone through hell and created a beautiful life for myself by the grace of God‚Ä¶ and want to show other that they can too.","The great love of my life is the Appalachian Trail. I‚Äôve wanted to hike it ever since I was a small child. I‚Äôve section hiked the first 167 miles, one weekend at a time since 2021. I eat, sleep and breathe The Trail. I do trail magic as often as possible. I love this trail and her people! I absolutely must do a thru-hike‚Ä¶ if not now, then in 11 years when I can get social security. I‚Äôll sell everything I own, give the landlord their apartment back, and head north the minute I hit 62, if I can‚Äôt do it sooner. The trail calls to me. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but if you know and love the AT‚Ä¶ you understand.","WHY? In a group I‚Äôm in, the question was asked, ‚ÄúWhat do you want to be remembered for? What do you want your legacy to be?‚Äù My answer was - and is! - this: I want my legacy to be showing people that it is possible not just to survive, but THRIVE after decades of abuse (childhood sexual and physical abuse by alcoholic and violent parents, followed by multiple domestic violence situations as an adult); I want to one day hike the *entire* Appalachian Trail not just for myself, but to show *all* abuse survivors that you CAN develop CONFIDENCE, self-worth, and the ability to do hard things and achieve your dreams‚Ä¶ even if your whole life people told you that you are nothing and nobody. Even if the voice in your head calls you an imposter. Even if (you think) people look at you as too fat, too thin, too weak, too weird, and so on. Old Me was a mere shadow of a human. Fearful. Trying to be as invisible as possible. Racing around from person to person and place to place in search of safety and security. Spoiler Alert: that NEVER worked well‚Ä¶ because I was looking for people who would accept me ‚Äúeven though‚Äù I was (insert all the negative adjectives here). Because, like Dorothy‚Äôs Ruby Slippers in the Wizard of Oz, I had no idea that the power was within me this whole time. I want to show people you CAN build a happy, joyful and fulfilling life‚Ä¶ whether or not you live alone with cats like I do üòÇ and no matter your age. I never hiked a day in my life before I was 47‚Ä¶ and I was 120 lbs overweight/morbidly obese at the time. Now I‚Äôve hiked the firstt 167 miles of the Appalachian Trail - one weekend at a time - and am plotting to do more. New Me does ADVENTURES. New Me EMBRACES my weird. New Me is highly selective about who I choose to spend time with (and if I hang out with you voluntarily, it‚Äôs a huge compliment). New Me does not hesitate to cut off toxic people without guilt ir regret. New Me THRIVES. It‚Äôs. Never. Too. Late. To. Thrive. Never. If I can spread actual hope and encouragement‚Ä¶ then I will have achieved my mission.","I draw tremendous inspiration from my faith, and from stories of others who have overcome severe hardship. The most recent time my courage surprised me was on my last section hike over Fourth of July weekend (Stecoah to Fontana Dam). I got caught in a surprise thunderstorm and had to set up my tent FAST and hunker down at Cody Gap for the night through several waves of heavy storms. The next day, instead of hiking only 6.6 miles to Fontana Dam, I had to hike at least 10 miles.. farther than I‚Äôve hiked in years. My phone charger got drowned in the rain while I was setting up my tent so I was without a phone. My Apple Watch tells me I hiked 14 miles the next day‚Ä¶ which I‚Äôve NEVER done before. The last couple miles were after nightfall. My mind was telling me all kinds of excuses why I couldn‚Äôt do such a thing‚Ä¶ but I did it anyway.","I will have learned what I‚Äôm made of. I‚Äôll have gained strength and courage that I don‚Äôt know was there. I will have faced more fears than ever before. Hopefully, I will serve as an example to other abuse survivors - and to my adult children, one of whom struggles with addiction issues - that turning your life around and doing hard things, doing great things, is possible- no matter where you came from and no matter how badly the deck is stacked against you at the beginning. No person, no situation, is ever beyond hope. I‚Äôm proof of this and want to inspire and show others they can do it to‚Ä¶ whatever ‚Äúit‚Äù is for them.","As you can see‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm very passionate about the Trail and what it means to me and so many others. All I can say is‚Ä¶ please give me a chance to live my dream‚Ä¶ not just for myself but to help others as well. I will spend the rest of my life ‚Äúpaying it forward.‚Äù I am not in a position financially to be able to do a thru hike without this scholarship. I‚Äôve no 401k, no savings, I live paycheck to paycheck working at a small rural law office and DoorDashing in the side, and nothing I own is worth enough sell to fund a thru hike. I don‚Äôt own any property. I‚Äôm willing to sell everything I own, but most of it is from thrift stores anyway and not worth much. This is the only shot I‚Äôve got until I retire. And no matter how careful I am, there‚Äôs no guarantee I‚Äôll be able to do it then because age and illness and injuries happen. 11 years is a long time.",Text,Other,"I saw your booth at Trail Days.

Patricia,Lefler,leflerpatricia@gmail.com,"1591 Kenmore Drive, Unit E",Kingsport,TN - Tennessee,37664,United States,14232767652,"I am 59 and want to complete trail on my 60th yr. I grew up in Baltimore, Md..joined Army at 18, graduated NC State in 1997, and was a state park ranger for SC and Tn. My husband and I had a son in 2005 and divorced. My life took a turn while fighting for custody of our child. I lost everything, including my freedom...crossing over into criminal activity trying to pay for attorneys. It has been a very long road back, as I have just regained my freedom from the criminal justice system earlier this year. Freedom is not the same now, but I want that part of me back who once traveled through life on her terms. I used to section hike the AT in my 20's and 30's. The best parts of my life have been spent either walking or building trails...being in nature. I'm just searching for that defining moment now, and to reconnect with God, and my true nature.","I'm planning for this adventure well in advance. Knowing it will have a financial cost gave me an idea to research possible scholarships (shot in the dark.) My personal funds are scarce and equipment is expensive, so I'm looking into everything. The truth is I'm going the distance whether I have the best and lightest gear or not, but in answering your question, possible funding help should not be ignored. I'd love to be considered for this scholarship.","As I mentioned previously, I have been connected to our criminal justice system (as an ""offender""), but I didn't mention 2 things. For one, it has been an ongoing struggle to free myself, from the system, for the last quarter part of my life. I've done a lot of positive things in the community, and developed strong friendships with good people, but my life has been so different. I want to be a positive influence on others...an example of never giving up...but I have to show myself first. I always said, ""one day I'm going to go the entire AT"", and now just seems like the perfect time.","I read the Bible for the first time at age 43, while spending 9-months in a solitary confinement jail cell...for a crime that was never committed, and that was eventually dismissed. The Word of God most assuredly strengthened and inspired me in those early days. I know it may not be easy for some to understand, or see it the same way, but it takes an incredible amout of something (it must be courage) to make it through all that I have and still believe in achieving dreams, still want to live (somehow knowing the future is a blank page waiting for another story to be written), and still believe in my ability to move on. This is actually more of an attitude, I guess, than courage. Thinking about going solo on the AT next year should probably scare me, and there are some unknowns that I don't allow myself too much time to ruminate on. I simply know it's what I need to do.","I want to spend time finishing several books. I'm a published writer but have not finished either my Memoir (about half way finished), or a novel I started several years ago. Walking the 2,000+ miles, being a finisher in that area of my life, will (I believe) inspire me to be a finisher in other areas.","Thank you for this Scholarship opportunity. I am amazed to see something like this out there. I know you'll have some incredible people, and stories, to choose from and whether or not I am chosen or another individual is, I pray you are able to continue your work for many years to come.

In recent years, I began doing long distance self-powered hikes and bike rides across the United States as an alternative to the addictions and struggles I faced prior. I have hiked half the AT and PCT, while having cycling upwards of 15k miles. Part of the time I work seasonal positions at ski resorts to afford being out there. In 2024, I hiked from Amicalola Falls to Damascus but got off trail due to the expenses being greater than expected.",Heard about it from people that went to Trail Days in 2024 and thought maybe my story matches its mission.,A challenge I've consistently faced is homelessness from PTSD. I find being on these adventures to be helpful because there's a freedom in being outdoors and the constant change keeps me present.

The first time I stepped on a long distance trail was the PCT in 2017, with only a few hundred dollars ended up completing half of it.

Sandra,Schmelzer,skaterinasch@gmail.com,7061 Snowy Canyon Dr Unit 110,Jacksonville,FL - Florida,32256,United States,17723218446,"I have lived in Florida most of my adult life but in 2021 and 2022 I lived in east TN. This is the time when I fell in love with hiking and backpacking. My son and I got out as much as possible, met fantastic people as excited to hike as I was, and before I knew it, I had completed 400+ miles of the 900 mile challenge of hiking all the trails of the Smoky Mountains. This is also the time when I discovered the AT and fantasized completing this insane feat one day. It seemed impossible at the time due to my family obligations and my endless financial struggles but early this year I began to really work towards a plan to make this dream a reality.","I saw a post in Facebook about this scholarship and my heart skipped a beat. This was the answer I had been looking for all year long. With some help I could have the best chance at accomplishing this dream. I have struggled financially all my adult life as I raise my child on my own. For me to succeed, I need to know that he will be OK. He is 18 y/o now and we talk constantly about ""our"" 2025 thru hike plans.","I am an immigrant who moved from Venezuela in 2003 at 20 years old. I was kind of forced to get married in 2004, and had my baby boy in 2006. When I was 11, my mother left for the US to try her luck here and eventually move the family here. The plans did not pan out and I lived without her until age 20. I have a exceptional father who sacrificed everything to raise his daughters and I am thankful for the unconditional love, the wisdom, and compassion that he instilled in me. However, I needed my mother. These feelings became stronger when I came to visit her in December of 2003 as I had done before, and in the spur of the moment I decided to stay with her. This is what she always wanted but leaving my country and family behind was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve done in my life. Things only got increasingly difficult. It took me years to let go and accept my new country and to overcome the culture and language shock. By then, I was already divorced, my ex-husband had fled the country to avoid child support, and soon I would realize that my son was autistic. The journey of raising my autistic child is one long and convoluted one but in short, I have always felt an absolute commitment to do everything in my power to make of him a responsible, productive, independent man one day. Our lives have been unstable, moving from place to place up to 3 times per year. I was able to go to college and though it took me 13 years to complete my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Nutrition Sciences, it was a huge achievement in my life. I was inspired to study nutrition after changing my son's diet one day and seeing how a severely autistic child became aware of the world around him and finally began to speak in full sentences at age 4, only 1 month after the dietary changes. From K and until 2nd grade, my son was lost in school despite the dramatic improvements, and so I physically attended school with him around 10-20 hours every week to ensure his advancement and prevent bullying. Several years I was told that he needed to be held back. I refused and continued my work at school, at home and maintaining a clean diet. In 2020, I was jobless, without my mother, with a deadline to move out of one place and nowhere to go. To top it off, I was forced to homeschool my son. I did doordash to survive and studied with my son in the car with whatever resources we could bring along. At age 14, I pushed him to test for college readiness. He was academically ready but ages behind developmentally and in life & social skills. I had to make really hard, risky decisions but over time they were proven right. Last May, 2 days before his 18th birthday, he graduated High School and also from college with an AA degree. He is still working on prereqs before he can transfer to a University in the Summer '25. These are just brief summaries of a few of the many obstacles I've faced over my adult life.","Honestly, as many challenges as I have endured and overcome, I am fearful of facing new ones. I might be broken at some level. Every time I break down to cry because I can't take it anymore, I begin thinking ""well, what else can I do? what are the alternatives?"". To me, accepting severe autism and potentially caring for an adult son in diapers, was not an option. To place him in school and see no progress while I developed myself in my profession, was not an option either. To medicate him in any shape or form to make life easier for me? No. I have had to constantly choose between two evils. To overcome my regular bouts of desperation I connect with my inner self and my ancestral wisdom. I allow myself to fall completely, and then I just pick myself up again and keep going. I guess I am surprised to see that no matter what happens to me, I will never give up on my kid.","The AT journey presents as a unique challenge to both me and my son because this is one that I am consciously seeking, and methodically planning and preparing for. This is a challenge for him as well because he has never been without me more than 3 weeks at a given time. We have a solid plan for him and he has a very positive attitude towards this, which means I am at peace. I hope that the trail teaches me who I am besides a mother and for my son to find who he can be without the constant cushion and assurances from his mom. Months ago, I wrote a long list of reasons to thru hike. Besides the ones mentioned above, living intensely is another one of my top reasons. Today we are here, tomorrow we aren't; as you, the parents of a son gone way too soon surely understand. I haven't addressed the actual question on purpose and that is because I know why I want to thru hike but I have no clue what revelations, inspirations, or opportunities the experience may bring. Who knows who I'll be at the end terminus and that is not something I want to dwell on. I have a tendency to be controlling and for years I have worked on myself to live more, let live, let things flow, and just improvise more often.","I just want to express that setting this scholarship for motivated hikers who struggle financially to make a thru hike a reality is an incredible act of kindness and generosity on your part.

Robert,Diamond,robdiamond811@gmail.com,13701 Courthouse Rd,Dinwiddie,VA - Virginia,23841,United States,17022193139,"It is always tough to write about yourself, but I will do my best to tell you a little about Robert ‚ÄúRob‚Äù Diamond. I am a 62 year old father of seven children. I was born into a military family, being the 5th of six children. Both my parents served in the US Air Force. Military service had always been an important part of the Diamond family. Much of my early childhood was spent being raised by my mother because my father was serving overseas during the Vietnam War. My mother got me involved in scouting so I would have positive male role models in my life. It was scouting that first introduced me to my love of the great outdoors. When my father finally retired from the military, he felt it important to try and spend time with his children and re-establish a connection with us. The Boy Scout troop that I was a member of did a lot of camping and backpacking. My father became a great role model. He accompanied me and my younger brother on many week long backpacking trips, some of which were the Sierra mountains in California, the Grand Canyon in Arizona, Zion National Park in Utah, Great Basin National Park in Nevada and the Uinta mountains in Utah. My father was not a young man and often finished most trips bringing up the rear, but never had ‚Äúquit‚Äù in his heart. My father encouraged a strong work ethic in all of his children. I worked from an early age and continued to work through my adult life. As a middle child in a large family, I had to work extra hard for my parents' approval and love. Many of my siblings would say that I was my parents‚Äô favorite child. I disagree. I always strived to do the best in my life. I earned the Eagle rank in scouting, the first in my family to do so. After graduation from high school, I was the first in my family to attend college and eventually earn a degree. At 21 I joined the military. Even though most of my family had served in the Air Force, I joined the Army. I was married at the time and my wife was in the Army, I joined and we planned to travel the world together. That never happened. I served in the Army for six years. I ended up being married twice while in the service, neither marriage worked out due to the separations that come with military life. While in the military I did a lot of volunteer work, some of which was to give back to the scouting program. I was eventually stationed in Virginia and it was here where I had my first contact with the Appalachian Trail. I took a small group of young men on a four state hike of the AT from Virginia to West Virginia and through Maryland and on to Pennsylvania. While on this trip I had my first contact with a thru hiker. He shared his story of hiking the AT and that is probably where I first developed a dream to one day hike the whole thing. While serving at Ft. Lee, VA I was first introduced to the fire service. I worked with a lady whose son was a volunteer firefighter for a local department. At the time I had planned to get out of the military and work for the Nat‚Äôl Park Service. I was told that having fire experience would help me get that job. I would ultimately work as a volunteer for several years and it was while assisting at a fire on Ft. Lee, VA that I was encouraged to apply for a job as a federal firefighter. I got out of the Army and began my career as a paid firefighter. A year later I would be recalled to active duty in the Army for service during Desert Storm. At the end of the conflict I returned to my job as a firefighter. I ultimately would marry for the third time. My wife was raising a special needs teenage child. My career as a firefighter would afford me many opportunities, my greatest being a Paramedic. I would ultimately serve 28 yrs as a firefighter/paramedic working for departments in Virginia and Nevada. Nevada is where I grew up and would consider it my true home because that is where my parents and siblings were living. I was afforded the opportunity to return home to Las Vegas, NV where I worked for one of the busiest fire departments in the country, Las Vegas Fire & Rescue. My wife and I were unable to have any children together so we considered adoption and/or fostering at the time. We would first foster special needs children for a number of years. One day in the year 2000 we would receive a phone call from a relative asking if we would take care of a newborn great-niece that was having medical needs and couldn‚Äôt be taken care of by her biological mother, my niece because she had a severe meth drug addiction. We would eventually become legal guardians of that baby girl and ultimately adopt her. While taking care of my great-niece we would continue to foster other children. At one point we were asked to adopt a young boy that had been in our care. After having him in our home for almost a year we began the process of adoption for him only to learn that he was Hep C/HIV positive. After much soul searching we decided to adopt him and he would officially become a Diamond. Over the next 5 years we would foster and adopt three other children. They were biological siblings of our other daughter ie. great-niece. All of which would come with their own special needs as a result of being born to a drug addict. The family would live in Las Vegas for the next 15 years at which time the wife had to move back to Virginia to take care of her parents. The plan had always been to move back to Virginia when I retired from Las Vegas Fire after 20 years. Because she had to move there, the kids would accompany her and I would commute back and forth for the last 5 years of my career. There were many challenges with this commute, but we made it work. With less than a year until retirement we were once again asked to take in another special needs child within our family. A niece on my wife‚Äôs side of the family was a heroin addict and she gave birth to a baby that was addicted to heroin. Because of our history with adoption and our ability to take care of special needs children, we chose to take temporary custody of the baby until they could wean him off of heroin and give the mother a chance to get clean. Unfortunately she was not able to do that, and later that year she was found dead in a local mall with two heroin needles in her arm. The biological father was unknown and the biological grandmother and siblings of my niece chose not to pursue adopting the baby. Our family came together and decided to make him a permanent part of our family. As with all our children, he has been faced with many challenges. He was diagnosed as a high functioning autistic child. As with hiking the AT, the only easy day was yesterday. My life has had many ‚ÄúPUDS‚Äù (pointless ups and downs) but through it all I have continued to take one step at a time. The year he came into my life was the same year Vegas had the Route 91 mass shooting that killed 58 people and then my father passed unexpectedly. PTSD had been a big part of my life for a number of years. These events were the straw that broke the camel's back. It was time for me to leave my beloved career and spend more time with my family in Virginia. For the past six years I have worked on spending more time with my family, been active in school activities and gotten involved with local veteran groups. It was Easter of this year that my family was having a discussion of everyone‚Äôs dreams and bucket list items. I told them that I wanted to thru hike the Appalachian trail. I had to explain the idea to the family and they said‚Ä¶‚Äùwell go do it!‚Äù Since March, I have focused my life on seeing if it was really possible.","Back in March when I decided to pursue a long dream of mine, I began to research if it was really possible for a 61 year old man to complete a 2200 mile walk from Georgia to Maine. I started watching YouTube videos, reading and listening to books about the AT. I found out about Trail Days in Damascus, VA and decided to attend in hope to learn more about what it would take to complete the trail. One of the many booths that I visited was the ‚ÄúOne More Day‚Äù booth. I learned about the scholarship to help hikers get out on the trail that were recovering from drug addiction or trauma and mental struggles. I made a donation and purchased a shirt. They told me that vets and first responders suffering from PTSD were eligible to apply for help. I took information about the scholarship. At the time I was thinking about others that I knew who were living with PTSD and how this might help get some others out on the trail that couldn‚Äôt do it financially otherwise. Later that day I was sitting in the Veteran memorial near the park. I was wearing a red t-shirt that my daughter had given me that had 22 on the back. A veteran walked up and asked if I was a member of the 22 A-Day Foundation. At the time I knew little about the program, but I told him that the 22 was the year my daughter had graduated from Virginia Military Institute. He told me about the 22 foundation and how we were losing 22 veterans a day to suicide. He wanted to thank me because they saved his life. He was on the verge of committing suicide when he reached out for help. It was at that moment that I knew regardless of what it took, I was going to thru hike the AT and bring attention to veteran suicide. When I returned home from trail days, I talked with family, especially my daughter who is a 1st Lieutenant in a Military Police company stationed in Hawaii. We came up with an idea to do a fundraiser to support veterans. Sticking with the number 22, we came up with the idea to ask friends and family for 1 penny for every mile I walk on the AT. This would mean $22 for each donation. I went to my monthly Veterans meeting and told them about the crazy idea of hiking the AT and raising money to help other veterans. I talked to them about the scholarship program and they encouraged me to apply. Many of them know how PTSD and drug addiction have directly impacted my life, while in the military, as a Firefighter/paramedic and in my personal life. I know there are many other more deserving recipients of your scholarship, but I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt say I could use the help in completing this goal I have set for myself.","A challenge that I was often faced with in my job as a paramedic was dealing with death and having to be the guy who had to tell family members that their loved one was dead and nothing more could be done. I am often asked by people what was the toughest call that I ever had in my career. It involved telling two sisters, ages 7 and 11, that their mother was dead. I responded to a shooting and while enroute, I received radio traffic that there were two victims so I called for additional help. Upon arrival I found a young female just inside the apartment with two gunshots to her chest and she was deceased. A police officer yelled at me that there was another victim in the other room. When I entered the room the officer told me that the male still had a pulse-but with my years of experience, I knew the outcome was not going to be good. He had shot himself in the head and much of his skull and brain matter were hanging from the ceiling. Seconds later he had no pulse and I pronounced him deceased. The officer told me the male individual had shot the young woman (his estranged girlfriend) and then shot himself. While we were talking, my backup arrived and the medic on the engine told me there were two more victims outside and I needed to go check them out. When I got outside, I found two young girls sitting in a police car. The older one had blood on her clothes and when checked it was determined that it was her mother‚Äôs blood. She was very quiet and didn‚Äôt want to answer any of my questions. Her sister on the other hand asked if her mom was going to be okay. I had learned never to lie to children when treating them. I told the younger sister that her mom was not going to be okay and she had died. To my surprise this young girl asked if I could go take her mommy‚Äôs organs and give them to someone else. I am 6‚Äô3‚Äù, a big guy and had often described myself as a Teddy Bear in a Grizzly bear costume. That day the teddy bear surely came out. It almost brought me to tears, but I had to stay tough in front of these little girls who had lost their mom. I told the younger sister that we couldn‚Äôt donate her mom‚Äôs organs, but that was not the end to a tough call. You see, this call happened two days before Christmas. When we entered the apartment there were Christmas decorations and a tree with presents. The youngest once again asked what would happen to them. Just before she asked the question, I was handed a piece of paper that had the grandmother's name and phone number along with the two girls' names. The police officer told me they were trying to reach her. I told the girls that they would be going to stay with their grandmother. But that was not the end of it, she then asked how Santa would find her. I answered it the only way I knew, ‚ÄúSanta will find you!‚Äù We stayed on scene until family arrived. When we returned to the station, we made sure these girls did not miss Christmas that year. Dealing with children on calls was always tough, dealing with children during a traumatic situation was even harder. In my 28 years in the fire service I could not tell you how many times I had to inform family of a loss, not a number I would care to remember, but each situation was different and CHALLENGING. What do I hope to get from the trail? Closure. I still have the slip of paper with the grandmother‚Äôs name and phone number and the girls' names, Tiffany and Brittney. Maybe I will find some place along my 2200 mile journey to leave it behind along with some of the other tough calls that I carry around in my mind and heart. Almost my entire life I have lived to serve others. Always putting them and their needs ahead of my own. I have never been able to put myself to the front of the line. Since leaving the military and fire service, I am continuously asked if I miss it. The answer I usually give is that I don‚Äôt miss the job, it is the people and fellowship that always took place in the military and fire service. It was the time spent with others that made the tough days and also the separation from our own families more bearable. They say the AT is a social experience, that is what I hope for the most. A few life long friends that might understand what I have experienced in my life and be there for each other during the tough days, both on the trail and after the trail.","For the most part, I find my inspiration in dealing with challenges and obstacles in other people and my life experiences. I know the world isn‚Äôt full of all good people, but I do know that there sure are a lot of good people out there. I watched my older sister fight cancer for years and not wanting to give up until she knew her children would be okay. She inspired me to never quit during tough times. The way people face challenges in their lives have always helped me deal with my own challenges. Small bites will help you get to the end of a meal that you don‚Äôt care for and small steps will get you to the end of a long, tough journey. Surprisingly, not all firefighters are fearless. Climbing a tall ladder, standing on top of a tall building, hanging from rope off the side of a dam, crawling in to a small space under ground, entering a burning building filled with smoke where you can‚Äôt see your hand in front of your face are just a few that I had to gut check many many times. But I must say the one thing I feared the most was not being able to go home at the end of a shift, leaving my family without a husband or father. Having the courage to face a different danger each day as a firefighter surprised me on a regular basis. Having the courage to leave and go to work often surprised me. On the day of 911, I woke up and saw what was happening in NYC. I knew we were under attack and Vegas was high on the list for a terrorist attack. That morning I surprised myself by going to work knowing that I may not come home the next day.","Well first, not finishing is not an option! I will take it slow and easy, one step at a time, one day at a time and just know that the sun will rise tomorrow. What do I wish for the most is to know how important I am to the rest of the world, mostly my family. One of my most favorite movies to watch is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Wonderful Life.‚Äù In the movie the main character makes a wish that he never existed. In the end he is shown just how much his life impacted the lives of others. There are days when I often wonder how my life has impacted others, and if others, especially my family, appreciate all that I have done. Being gone for six months, I wonder about household tasks, who will mow the grass, take my little man to school, fix the broken water line, do the dishes, BBQ dinner on the grill, hook the generator up to the house when the power goes out, just to name a few. I know my family has encouraged me to do this trip, but I wonder if they have really thought about what it will be like to not have me around for day after day. I guess what I wish for is to be appreciated. I know I have made a huge difference in the lives of many, but I guess I feel like I get taken for granted of on a regular basis, and I just allow it to happen. It will be nice to know that the only person that will depend on me while on the trail is ME! It‚Äôs time to put Rob first!","I know most military and first responders will deny having PTSD because it is felt as a sign of weakness to others in the same profession. I surely have fallen into that category and have struggled daily in many ways. I know I am probably not the best or most deserving individual to receive a One More Day Scholarship to help me fulfill a long time dream. But just being considered is enough for me. Financially, I will make my dream come true regardless. I may not have the best equipment or be able to take more rest days, but my drive to get to the end is there. I am a retiree on a fixed income and my wife recently stopped working as a teachers aide due to medical problems. The extra money that the scholarship could provide, would definitely make the trip easier on this ol‚Äô man and the finances of my family. I do have some medical conditions that may require me to get off trail to pick up mail packages or go for treatments. I have ulcerative colitis and some of my dietary needs may not be the same as your typical thru hiker. I am a talker and walker, I love sharing my story. I would love to be the voice for not only veteran suicide, but the One More Day program. Our society has a huge drug problem and Fentanyl is taking way too many young lives. At a recent Veteran function, we had a guest speaker that made us aware that we are losing 22 teen lives a month to fentanyl. I hope to bring attention to this problem, as well, while out on the trail. Regardless, thank you for the opportunity to apply for this scholarship and I look forward to stopping by the booth next year when I visit Trail Days 2025..",Phone,Other,"While attending Trail Days in Damascus, VA 2024 I visited your information booth.",Review In Progress,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kW5uV_zMHFKwiK5EkQ17dFvkgNUITUmp,September 12 2024

That has recently changed. I know grants exist for people wanting to go on adventures. As I do not come from money of any sort, saving up for the AT would take me years to do. And I would like to do it before I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs. I love the outdoors and is really where I am at peace the most. There is so much beauty outdoors. So much interesting stuff I see everyday, that I may have never seen before. Fungi, bugs, flowers.

I stopped going to school for now. I couldn‚Äôt focus anymore. But with that, I realized how truly short and fragile this life is. The Appalachian Trail has always been high on my bucket list.

Carolyn,King,doozerck@yahoo.com,174 Clifton St,Peterborough,NY - New York,123456,Canada,17058758410,"I am female, born in 1983, and have been in recovery since February 14, 2016. I have been working in the harm reduction sector for seven years now and am an advocate and activist for people who use drugs to have access to life-saving and life-preserving services in my community. I am also a member and sponsor in my local twelve-step fellowship, and consider spiritual health and service to others essential parts of my ongoing recovery. My current work in harm reduction is coming to an end in the spring of 2025 due to the changing political priorities in Canada, which are resulting in the de-funding of services like my program. This is heartbreaking for me both professionally and personally, as I have seen the value of harm reduction in my own life as well as in the lives of the people I serve. I fully believe that where there is life, there is hope, and harm reduction at its core preserves life. However, with the end of my job comes a unique opportunity: For the first time in my whole recovery, I will be both out of work and school (I graduated from university this past summer, a 7-year part-time process that was also a recovery dream of mine), and am faced with the dilemma with what's next for me. For all of these years in recovery, I have been working so hard to achieve the dreams that drugs stole from me, and there is one giant dream left on the shelf from before addiction took over my life: to thru-hike the AT. Hiking and backpacking are a huge part of my history, and a huge part of my recovery now. I have decided to go after this dream by doing a flip-flop thru-hike next year, after finishing out my academic and professional work with as much integrity and heart as I can. *** Please note that the drop-down menus above did not always include Canadian options, and so the correct information for my province and postal code are Ontario, K9H 1J5.","I was drawn to apply for this scholarship because Nate's story so easily could have been my own. I am one of the lucky ones who survived my years of active addiction, but I attribute that to luck more than anything else. I am no more deserving of a happy and joyous recovered life than any other person struggling with addiction, but as someone who did survive and come out the other side, I owe it to my friends and others who were not so fortunate to live my life to the fullest and not take my recovery for granted. I first heard of the AT at age 16, before a drug had ever entered my body. I dreamed of thru-hiking after graduating high school, and planned obsessively (in the way teenagers do best). Unfortunately, I found drugs (or drugs found me) at age 18, and my addiction took over very quickly. There were no post-high school dreams for me anymore, just an agonizing descent into a life I equated to a hell on earth. I could not escape it, and the only thing I knew to do was to keep using drugs to escape the increasingly traumatic reality of my existence. My addiction eventually led me to the streets, where I was homeless for years and without any hope of recovery. The biggest miracle of my life is that I survived it all, and the second biggest miracle of my life is that I found recovery. One of the most formative moments of my early recovery was reconnecting with backpacking, which is something my addiction took away from me for many years. Getting back on a trail and realizing I could still do it gave me so much hope and confidence in myself to keep going and to remember why I was trying to recover in the first place. Reading Nate's story resonated so deeply within me, for I too am deeply familiar with the feeling he described of connecting to recovery on the trail. I am so grateful that this foundation exists to connect other addicts seeking recovery with that same joy and wonder that Nate felt, for I feel it, too.","Finding recovery in my mid-30s, and suddenly contemplating a life in which I might survive into middle age and beyond, meant that I had to scramble and grind without stopping to catch up on the lost time and lost financial future that most of my peers had secured. I started out unhoused, physically and psychologically dependent on multiple substances, hustling for money to get by through very traumatizing means, and with no job or education history to speak of. I was also very physically ill with a history of heart infections from IV drug use, a pulmonary embolism due to drug use, and many, many overdoses. I am closing in on a decade of recovery, living a life I never expected to have. I worked so hard to make up for some of that lost time in my life, and am so proud of how far I've come. I have relationships with my family, I have a husband and a home (I got married this year, at 41 years old to the man of dreams who supports me in my recovery every step of the way), I have built a career I'm proud of and good at, I have a university degree, and I have been able to hike every year. I have been tireless and relentless in my pursuit of a life worth living, and am grateful beyond measure for where I am. However, after all of this building up, I am finally tired. I feel burned out, and am unsure of where to go next with my professional life. To start with nothing and to work as hard as I could to build something, and then be standing on the precipice of the unknown again is very daunting. I don't want to jump into something else out of fear or out of my lingering scarcity mindset that is so ingrained from being on the streets. That doesn't feel productive in the way that I need now. Now, I am seeking a break from the grind of building this wonderful life, to truly contemplate what my next chapter could look like. I am yearning for this chunk of time away, to continue building my spiritual life and my relationship with myself. I want to hike the AT for the 16-year old version of me who never got to realize her dreams, and heal that part of me. I have touched on the barriers that kept me from the AT and from the woods entirely already, but there are also barriers to hiking next year. Part of this wonderful life I've built includes building an actual home base here in my town. When I first envisioned a thru-hike, I planned to lean into my transient beginnings and just give up my apartment when I left for the trail. However, life took another magical turn this year when I moved into an actual home for the first time in my life. Suddenly, thru-hiking the AT now also includes the cost of carrying the entirety of my bills back home while I'm away - mortgage payment, utilities, insurance, etc. This more than doubles what my initial cost plan was for the hike, which of course is resulting in significant anxiety and second thoughts of whether now is truly the right time to thru-hike. This financial anxiety is amplified by my trauma history of losing my housing and ending up homeless, and then further compounded by the fact that the job I excel at in the sector I am passionate about, won't even exist when I return home. This hike will not even be possible if I do not somehow secure the extra funds required to secure the duration of my hike as well as the uncertainty of the month or two after the hike (if I successfully complete it) while I once again face building a professional life from the bottom up.","I find inspiration primarily from other recovering addicts. Watching other people come alive in their recovery is the most amazing and awe-inspiring phenomenon I've ever had the privilege to witness. We comes from being these hollowed out husks of ourselves with no faith in ourselves, no trust, no self-esteem, and grow into full people with rich lives and full humanity. It is truly miraculous be part of. In addition to this, my other main inspiration and source of strength is the woods. Any time I feel overwhelmed by life, or like I'm standing on shaky ground, the woods are there to remind me of the magnitude of awe in this world. Feeling part of nature is when I feel most connected to God in my life. In early recovery, I dubbed my hikes my ""God Walks"", because I spend the majority of my time out there talking out loud to the God of my understanding. Healing my stuff. Connecting. I hike mostly alone, and the highlight of every year is doing my week-long hike in an area that is new to me. It is my greatest and most precious recovery tradition, doing this hike and remembering how it felt to go out that first time in recovery and realize I could do it.","At the end of my hike, I hope to finally heal that last broken dream of my 16-year old self that addiction took from me. In my recovery, I have worked so hard to cross off my young self's dreams one by one, no matter how hard it was or how long it took. Giving her this thru-hike is the last loving gift I can return to her, and would mark a momentous turning point in my healing journey. I can't reach back through time and hug my past self, or tell her it's all going to be okay, but I can reach for her dreams now, and live for my present and future self. I don't speak of this part of my thru-hike dream much as it is so deeply person, but this is what lies at the true heart of my dream. Even writing this is making me cry, so I will end this section here.","I just want to say again how beautiful this scholarship program is, and I hope that the recipient(s) find everything they are looking for out there. We deserve to live free, and for any addict who is seeking recovery, I want them to know that hope is alive. Where there is life, there is hope. And the woods are so full of both life and hope.",Email,Social Media,,Review In Progress,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AzChUfG2OUf-ixKcviAa42HHH7iAUoLF,December 27 2024
